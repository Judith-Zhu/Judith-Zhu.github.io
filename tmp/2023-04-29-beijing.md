Congressman George Santos Visits New Federal State of China Headquarters Base

On May 5, Congressman George Santos visited the the New Federal State of China (NFSC) Headquarters Base situated in New Jersey

   

 He said: "There are organizations out there, like you guys now, that are fighting not only for freedom

   

 but for clarity and transparency to expose all the corruption that went around globally



 Now we will have more important missions such as ending global communism

   

 and introducing legislation to stop Americans from funding communist regimes around the world

   

 If we stop funding them, they will die."

   

 Santos also suggested that the US Congress has become broadly aware of the threat posed by the CCP

   

 Both parties in the United States are now unanimously committed to taking down the CCP, in other words, there is no partisanship in this initiative!

   

 Santos welcomed the citizens of the NFSC to go up to Capitol Hill and "educate" every senator and representative!

 The NFSC has not, does not, and will not interfere in US politics, and its only goal is to take down the CCP while protecting US interests

 Santos also said: "Within the next 2 to 3 weeks, there will be a different update on the CCP's position

   

 and will advocate for a fair justice system and trial for Mr. Guo Wengui

   

 I hope you don't give up, don't back down, keep fighting. We will work together to free everyone from the Chinese Communist Party and bring down Xi Jinping."

   

 This is a major milestone for the citizens of the NFSC on the road to taking down the CCP. With the dawn of victory ahead of us, let's keep it up and march on!
